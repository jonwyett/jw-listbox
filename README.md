Excellent news! Reaching MVP is a major milestone. Congratulations on guiding Project Janus to this point.

Creating clear, welcoming, and effective documentation is just as important as writing the code itself. Here is a draft of the `README.md` file, designed to give a new developer everything they need to get excited about the project, understand its philosophy, and get started quickly.

# JwListBox: A Modern, Dependency-Free List & Grid Component

**JwListBox** is a high-performance, flexible, and developer-friendly JavaScript component for displaying interactive lists and grids of data. It is built from the ground up with modern standards, has zero dependencies, and is designed to be a powerful engine for any data presentation task.

This library is a complete, modern rewrite of the legacy `jwListBox_5.3.2.js`, built under the codename **Project Janus**. It retains the powerful feature set of the original while replacing the underlying architecture with a robust, performant, and extensible foundation.

## ‚ú® Philosophy & Key Features

-   **Zero Dependencies:** Pure vanilla JavaScript. No jQuery, no external libraries. Drop it into any project (React, Vue, Svelte, or plain HTML) without conflicts.
-   **Headless UI Approach:** The core component is a powerful display engine. You have 100% control over the surrounding UI (search boxes, pagination, etc.), allowing for maximum layout flexibility.
-   **Dual Display Modes:** Render your data as a semantic, accessible `<table>` (grid mode) or a fully customizable, templated `<ul>` (list mode). Switch between modes at any time.
-   **Powerful Data Engine:** Built on top of the `jw-datamaster` library (a required peer), it provides robust in-memory data manipulation, including complex sorting and filtering.
-   **Secure & Accessible:** Designed with modern web standards at its core. It's secure by default (escaping templated data to prevent XSS) and accessible (using semantic HTML and ARIA roles).
-   **Highly Extensible:** A rich event system, including lifecycle hooks (`beforeRender`, `render`), allows you to easily extend the component's functionality to meet your application's needs.
-   **Easy to Style:** Comes with a sensible, functional default theme that is incredibly easy to override with standard CSS. No `!important` hacks needed. Or, turn off the default styles completely for a "blank slate" to build your own theme.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Getting started with JwListBox is simple.

#### 1. Include the necessary scripts

You need both the `datamaster.js` engine and the `jw-listbox.js` component.

```html
<!-- In your HTML file -->
<head>
    <!-- ... -->
    <script src="path/to/datamaster.js"></script>
    <script src="path/to/jw-listbox.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/your/app.css">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- The container where the listbox will live -->
    <div id="my-listbox-container" style="height: 400px; position: relative;"></div>

    <script src="path/to/your/app.js"></script>
</body>
```

#### 2. Create your data

JwListBox accepts an array of objects (a "recordset").

```javascript
// In your app.js
const myData = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Alice Smith', email: 'alice@example.com', status: 'active' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Bob Johnson', email: 'bob@example.com', status: 'inactive' },
    { id: 3, name: 'Charlie Brown', email: 'charlie@example.com', status: 'active' }
    // ... more data
];
```

#### 3. Initialize the ListBox

Create a new instance, pointing it to your container and providing the data.

```javascript
// In your app.js

// 1. Get a reference to the container
const container = '#my-listbox-container';

// 2. Create the listbox instance
const listbox = new JwListBox(container);

// 3. Configure it using the fluent API
listbox
    .setSource(myData)
    .setIdField('id')       // Tell it which field is the unique identifier
    .setDisplayMode('grid') // We'll start with a grid view
    .setUseDefaultStyles(true); // Use the nice default theme
```

That's it! You now have a fully functional, interactive grid on your page.

## üìñ Basic Usage

JwListBox uses a clean, chainable API for configuration and control.

### Setting the Display Mode

Switch between a grid and a templated list.

```javascript
// Render as a table
listbox.setDisplayMode('grid');

// Render as a ul, which requires a template
listbox.setTemplate('#my-item-template').setDisplayMode('list');
```
*Your HTML would need a `<template id="my-item-template">...</template>` for this to work.*

### Sorting and Searching

Manipulate the displayed data on the fly.

```javascript
// Sort by name, descending
listbox.sort('name', true);

// Show only active users
listbox.search({ status: 'active' });

// Clear the search and show all data again
listbox.clearSearch();
```

### Handling Events

Listen for user interactions to drive your application's logic.

```javascript
listbox.on('select', (payload) => {
    console.log('Items selected!', payload.selectedIds);
    // e.g., update a details panel with the first selected item's data
    if (payload.selectedData.length > 0) {
        showDetailsFor(payload.selectedData[0]);
    }
});

listbox.on('click', (payload) => {
    console.log(`Row clicked! ID: ${payload.id}, Name: ${payload.rowData.name}`);
});
```

## üé® Styling & Customization

Customizing the look and feel is straightforward.

#### Overriding Default Styles

Simply write standard CSS rules in your own stylesheet. Because our default styles have low specificity, your rules will take precedence.

```css
/* In your app.css */

/* Change the default selection color for all listboxes */
.jw-listbox__row--selected {
    background-color: #D24D57; /* A nice red */
    color: white;
}

/* Style a specific listbox differently */
#my-listbox-container .jw-listbox__row--selected {
    background-color: #4CAF50; /* A nice green */
}
```

#### Using a "Blank Slate"

If you want to design a completely custom theme from scratch, simply disable the default styles during initialization.

```javascript
const unstyledListbox = new JwListBox('#app', { useDefaultStyles: false });
```
The component will now be rendered with only essential structural styles, giving you full control over its appearance.
