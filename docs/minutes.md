### **Meeting Minutes**

**Project:** `JwListBox` Component Rewrite
**Date:** [Current Date]
**Attendees:** Project Lead, Lead Architect (AI Consultant)
**Subject:** Final Architectural Design & Development Planning

#### **1. Meeting Objective**

To finalize the core architecture, design principles, and development plan for the complete rewrite of the `jwListBox` JavaScript component. The primary goal is to create a modern, dependency-free, robust, and maintainable library that honors the feature set of the original while discarding its legacy technical implementation.

#### **2. Summary of Discussions & Decisions**

The following key architectural decisions were discussed and unanimously approved:

*   **Core Technology Stack:**
    *   **Decision:** The component will be written in pure, modern **vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** with **zero runtime dependencies**. The legacy jQuery dependency is to be completely removed.
    *   **Rationale:** To ensure maximum compatibility, performance, and adherence to modern web standards.

*   **API Design:**
    *   **Decision:** The component will be instantiated with a minimal constructor (`new JwListBox(parentElement)`) and configured via a **fluent, chainable API** (e.g., `.setSource().setSort()`). The "options soup" constructor is deprecated.
    *   **Rationale:** To improve API discoverability, readability, and robustness by preventing invalid configuration states and race conditions.

*   **Data Management:**
    *   **Decision:** The component will use the external `jw-datamaster` library as its sole data engine. An internal, non-intrusive **`_rowMap` data structure** will be used to manage internal primary keys and map data rows to DOM elements, keeping the user's data pristine.
    *   **Rationale:** To achieve a clean separation of concerns (View vs. Model) and to provide a powerful, non-polluting "escape hatch" for advanced users to access the raw `DataMaster` object.

*   **Rendering Architecture:**
    *   **Decision:** A **dual-mode rendering engine** will be implemented, using a semantic `<table>` for 'grid' mode and a semantic `<ul>` for 'list' mode. A **batched rendering pipeline** using `requestAnimationFrame` will be used to prevent UI flicker from chained API calls.
    *   **Rationale:** To use the correct semantic HTML for the job, improving accessibility and layout flexibility, while ensuring high performance through update batching.

*   **DOM Integration:**
    *   **Decision:** The component will inject a controlled wrapper `<div>` and programmatically ensure the user-provided parent container has `position: relative`.
    *   **Rationale:** To guarantee a stable positioning context and a "just works" integration experience for the developer, eliminating common layout issues.

*   **Event Handling:**
    *   **Decision:** All user interaction events will be handled via the **Event Delegation** pattern, using a single listener on a parent container.
    *   **Rationale:** For performance, security (CSP compliance), and to create a fully encapsulated component that does not rely on global variables.

*   **Security:**
    *   **Decision:** The templating engine will be **secure by default**, escaping all data rendered with `{{...}}` syntax. A separate `{{{...}}}` syntax will be provided for explicitly rendering raw HTML.
    *   **Rationale:** To protect end-users from XSS attacks injected via the data source, which is a core responsibility of a modern UI library.

#### **3. Development Plan & Documentation**

The following document-driven development plan was approved:

1.  **Style & Architecture Guide:** A foundational document defining coding standards, naming conventions, and architectural patterns. (Status: **Completed**)
2.  **Project Overview:** A high-level document establishing the project's mission, philosophy, and core architectural pillars. (Status: **Completed**)
3.  **Comprehensive Feature Inventory:** A detailed list of all features from the original library to ensure feature parity. (Status: **Completed** and merged into Project Overview)
4.  **Architectural Decision Record:** A context document explaining the rationale behind key technical decisions. (Status: **Completed**)
5.  **Sprint List & Development Plan:** A detailed, incremental plan breaking the project into logical, testable sprints. (Status: **Completed**)

#### **4. Action Items**

1.  **Begin Development:** Initiate the development process starting with **Sprint 1: The Control Chassis**, using the finalized documentation as the guide. The "priming prompt" will consist of all approved documents.
2.  **Continuous Verification:** At the end of each sprint, the output will be reviewed against the requirements and tested to ensure correctness before proceeding to the next sprint.
