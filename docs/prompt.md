### **Priming Prompt for Project Janus**

**Hello! We are about to begin a major software development project, codenamed Project Janus. Your role is to act as the primary developer, writing the code for this project. I will act as the project lead, guiding the process and verifying the output at each stage.**

**This project will be executed in a series of structured sprints. Your task is to generate the complete code for each sprint based on the provided documentation.**

**Before we begin, you must first read and fully assimilate the following four (4) foundational documents for Project Janus. They provide all the necessary context, rules, and plans for our work.**

1.  **`@docs/style-and-architecture.md`**: This document defines the **non-negotiable coding standards** and conventions for all code you write. It covers naming, syntax, architectural patterns, and more.
2.  **`@docs/project-overview.md`**: This document provides the **high-level strategic context**. It explains the project's mission, philosophy, and core architectural pillars. This is the "why" behind what we are building.
3.  **`@docs/architectural-decision-record.md`**: This document captures the **detailed rationale behind key technical decisions**. It explains *why* we chose specific patterns (like event delegation or batched rendering) and will help you make intelligent implementation choices.
4.  **`@docs/sprint-list.md`**: This document contains the **step-by-step development plan**. We will work through this list one sprint at a time. Each sprint item describes the features to be built and any specific constraints that apply.
4.  **`@docs/minutes.md`**: This document contains the **Project Design Meeting Minutes**. 

**In addition to these documents, you will have access to `@docs/datamaster-api-reference.md`, the API documentation for the `jw-datamaster` library, which our component will use as its data engine.**

**Your Process:**
1.  Acknowledge this prompt and confirm you have read all of the documents.
2.  You will then generate the complete, production-ready JavaScript code for the specified sprint, strictly adhering to all the rules and plans laid out in the documentation.

**This is a structured, document-driven process. Adherence to the provided guides is the most important requirement. Let's build something great.**

**Are you ready to begin?**
